# hello-world
The first repository
Starting with GitHub.com. PHP is Great! JAVA is Great too! But at least I want to learn one language!
I'm 23 years old. I work at school. But I'm not satisfied with my "big" sallary, so I want to start my developer's career and earn enough money to have a really good life for me and my family!
